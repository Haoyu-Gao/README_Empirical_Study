In the spirit of [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava/), Cava is a set of libraries and other tools to aid development of blockchain and other decentralized software in Java and other JVM languages.

It includes a low-level bytes library, serialization and deserialization codecs (e.g. [RLP](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP)), various cryptography functions and primatives, and lots of other helpful utilities.

Cava is developed for JDK 1.8 or higher, and depends on various other FOSS libraries, including Guava.

## Getting cava

> Note that these libraries are experimental and are subject to change.

The libraries are published to [ConsenSys bintray repository](https://consensys.bintray.com/consensys/) and linked to JCenter.

You can import all modules using the cava jar.

With Maven:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.consensys.cava</groupId>
  <artifactId>cava</artifactId>
  <version>0.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

With Gradle: `compile 'net.consensys.cava:cava:0.3.0'`

[PACKAGES.md](PACKAGES.md) contains the list of modules and instructions to import them separately.
