In the spirit of [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava/), Cava is a set of libraries and other tools to aid development of blockchain and other decentralized software in Java and other JVM languages.

It includes a low-level bytes library, serialization and deserialization codecs (e.g. [RLP](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP)), various cryptography functions and primitives, and lots of other helpful utilities.

Cava is developed for JDK 1.8 or higher, and depends on various other FOSS libraries, including Guava.
