# GCR Catalogs

This repo hosts the mock galaxy catalogs used by [DESCQA2](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/descqa).

On a NERSC machine, all these catalogs can be directly accessed through the "Generic Catalog Reader" (GCR) interface.
More information about GCR can be found [here](https://github.com/yymao/generic-catalog-reader).

Currently these sets of catalogs are available (**Note that these catalogs are not perfect and will continue to be updated**):

1. protoDC2:
   by Eve Kovacs, Danila Korytov, Andrew Benson, Katrin Heitmann et al.
   - `protoDC2` (full catalog)
   
2. Buzzard series:
   by Joe DeRose, Risa Wechsler, Eli Rykoff et al.
   - `buzzard` (full catalog, DES Y3 area)
   - `buzzard_test` (same as `buzzard` but a small subset for testing purpose)
   - `buzzard_high-res` (higher resolution, smaller sky area)
   - `buzzard_v1.6_1`, `buzzard_v1.6_2`, `buzzard_v1.6_3`, `buzzard_v1.6_5`, `buzzard_v1.6_21` (different realizations of `buzzard`)
      
3. DC1 catalog:
   - `dc1`

Each of the catalogs is specified by a YAML config file, which can be found [here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/gcr-catalogs/tree/master/GCRCatalogs/catalog_configs). The galaxy quantities in these catalogs conform to [this schema](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUsImkBkjjw82Xa_-3a8VMV6K9aYJ8mXioaRhz0JoqI/edit).

## Prerequisites

This project is built based on Python. Make sure to use Python 3.x before getting started. Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

## Installation Steps

### Option 1: Manual Installation

You can install the latest version by running (but note that you need to change the python paths accordingly):

```
pip install https://github.com/LSSTDESC/gcr-catalogs/archive/master.zip
```

Note that the actual catalogs can only be accessed on a NERSC machine.

### Verification

To verify the successful installation, run the following command:
```
import GCRCatalogs
```

## Usage and examples

- See [this notebook](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/gcr-catalogs/blob/master/examples/GCRCatalogs%20Demo.ipynb) for a tutorial on how to use GCR Catalogs.
- See [this notebook](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/gcr-catalogs/blob/master/examples/CLF%20Test.ipynb) for an actual application (the Conditional Luminosity Function test) using GCR Catalogs.

## External Documents

Provide additional documents for users to explore the comprehensive documents, e.g., `INSTALL.md`, `WIKI`, `CONTRIBUTE.md`, etc.

## Version History

See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/gcr-catalogs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details on changes and updates.

## Contributing

To contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. **Fork** the project repository to your GitHub account.
   
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:YourGitHubUsername/gcr-catalogs.git
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/LSSTDESC/gcr-catalogs.git
   ```

2. **Sync** with the upstream master branch (**always do this!**)
   
   ```
   cd /your/own/directory/gcr-catalogs
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   git push origin master
   ```

3. **Create a new branch** for your edit:
   
   ```
   git checkout -b newBranchName master
   ```

4. **Make changes** and test by adding your clone to the path when running Python:
   
   ```python
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, '/your/own/directory/gcr-catalogs')
   ```

5. **Commit and push** to your forked repo:
   
   ```
   git add <files changed>
   git commit -m <short but meaningful message>
   git push origin newBranchName
   ```

6. Go to your forked repo's GitHub page and "create a pull request".
