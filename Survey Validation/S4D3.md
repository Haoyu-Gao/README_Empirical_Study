# Shipkit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mockito/shipkit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mockito/shipkit)

## Project Overview

You will be more productive if your releases are fully automated and happen on every change. You will build a great product if you can focus on code & features, but not on the release overhead. Shipkit will make it happen. Shipkit is a toolkit for shipping it.

Every team should be empowered to develop with rapid velocity, frictionless releases, and semantic versioning just like [we do it in Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/Continuous-Delivery-Overview). Shipkit enables Mockito to automatically publish new versions to [2M Mockito users](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/Mockito-Popularity-and-User-Base)!

<details>
  <summary>Fully automated releases are only the first part of the journey...</summary>

  Imagine the world where you call pull in a new version of some Open Source library and not worry if it breaks compatibility.
  Imagine that you can submit a pull request to some project, have it reviewed timely, and have the new version with your fix available to you in minutes after your PR is merged.
  Imagine that for any dependency you consider upgrading, you can view its neatly and consistently maintained release notes.
  Imagine that you can set up practical Continuous Delivery automation in your project in minutes, by using a well behaving and documented Gradle plugin.
  Imagine that you can focus on code and features while the release management, versioning, publishing, and automation is taken care of.

  Welcome to the world we are building. With your help, it will become a reality!
