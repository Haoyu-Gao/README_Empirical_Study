## Project Overview
Sulong (Graal LLVM) is an interpreter for LLVM IR written in Java using the Truffle language implementation framework and Graal as a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. With Sulong, you can execute C/C++, Fortran, and other programs written in LLVM language on the JVM. To execute a program by Sulong, you have to compile the program to LLVM IR by a LLVM front end such as Clang. By using Truffle and Java, the interpreter implementation is simple and is thus a great platform for experimentation. On the other hand, dynamic optimizations and JIT compilation with Graal still provide native execution speed (improving performance is work in progress). Through Truffle's language interoperability capabilities, you will soon be able to call functions from/to other languages on Truffle such as Ruby, JavaScript, or R.

## Prerequisites
This project is built based on Java. Make sure to use Java before getting started. Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- LLVM (incl. CLANG and OPT tool) v3.2 - v4.0
- `libc++`
- `libc++abi`

### Installation Steps:
Choose one of the following options to install the project:
#### Option 1: Manual Installation
1. Create a new directory, which will contain the needed GraalVM projects:
    ```sh
    mkdir sulong-dev && cd sulong-dev
    ```
2. Download mx, which is the build tool used by Sulong:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/graalvm/mx
    export PATH=$PWD/mx:$PATH
    ```
3. Use git to clone the Sulong project and its dependencies:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/graalvm/sulong.git
    cd sulong
    mx build
    ```

#### Option 2: Using Package Manager

#### Verification
To verify the successful installation, run the following command:
```sh
mx su-tests
```

#### Advanced Option

### Building and Running Sulong
- To build Sulong:
    ```sh
    mx build
    ```
- To run the test suite:
    ```sh
    mx su-tests
    ```
- To execute a program:
    ```sh
    mx su-run <program>
    ```
- To run Sulong with LLVM opt:
    ```sh
    mx su-opt <llvm-ir-file>
    ```
- To compile C/C++ to LLVM IR:
    ```sh
    mx su-clang <source-file>
    ```
