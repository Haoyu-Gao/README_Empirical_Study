The Eclipse Dataspace Connector provides a framework for sovereign, inter-organizational data exchange. It will
implement the International Data Spaces standard (IDS) as well as relevant protocols associated with GAIA-X. The
connector is designed in an extensible way in order to support alternative protocols and integrate in various
ecosystems.

Please also refer to:

- The [Eclipse Project Homepage](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspaceconnector)
- [International Data Spaces](https://www.internationaldataspaces.org)
- The [GAIA-X](https://gaia-x.eu) project
- The [Onboarding Guide](onboarding.md)

### Built with

One of the guiding principles in developing the connector is simplicity and keeping the core small and efficient with as
little external dependencies as possible to avoid version conflicts. We do not want to force any third-party
dependencies onto our users, so we aim to avoid any of the big frameworks. Of course, if you want to use them, you still
can add them to your extensions (see: [TBW]). The connector is a plain Java application built with Gradle, but it can be
embedded into any form of application deployment.

### Documentation

Developer documentation can be found under [docs/developer](docs/developer/),
where the main concepts and decisions are captured as [decision records](docs/developer/decision-records/).

Some more documentation can be found at [extensions](extensions/), [launchers](launchers/) and [samples](samples/).

For detailed information about the whole project, please take a look at our [GitHub pages](https://eclipse-dataspaceconnector.github.io/docs).

## Getting Started

### Add Maven dependencies

Official versions are available through [MavenCentral](https://search.maven.org/search?q=org.eclipse.dataspaceconnector)
.
Please add the following instructions in your `build.gradle[.kts]` file (if not already present):

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    // ... other maven repos
}
```

We **strongly** recommend to use official versions and only switch to snapshots if there is a clear need to do so, or
you've been instructed to do so, e.g. to verify a bugfix.

All artifacts are under the `org.eclipse.dataspaceconnector` group id, for example:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("org.eclipse.dataspaceconnector:spi:core-spi:<<version>>")
    // any other dependencies
}
```

#### Using `SNAPSHOT` versions

In addition, EDC regularly publishes snapshot versions, which are available at Sonatype's snapshot
repository. In
order to add them to your build configuration, simply add this:

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url = uri("https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/")
    }
    // any other repos
}
```

Then you can add snapshot dependencies by simply using the `-SNAPSHOT` version suffix:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("org.eclipse.dataspaceconnector:spi:core-spi:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT")
    // any other dependencies
}
```

A comprehensive list of all available modules can be found [here](docs/developer/modules.md). This file will always
list the most recent _snapshot_ version, please check MavenCentral for official versions.

Please be aware of the following pitfalls:

- snapshots are by definition unstable - every new snapshot replaces an old one
- this may cause unrepeatable builds
- snapshots are created irregularly, we do not have any fixed publish schedule

#### Using release versions

_We plan to have actual release versions starting some time mid 2022. Please check back soon._


> For more information about versioning please refer to the [release documentation](docs/developer/releases.md)

### Checkout and build from source

The project requires JDK 11+. To get started:

``` shell 
git clone git@github.com:eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector.git

cd DataSpaceConnector

./gradlew clean build
```

That will build the connector and run unit tests.

### [Optional] Setup your IDE

If you wish to configure your IDE/editor to automatically apply the EDC code style, please
follow [this guide](styleguide.md).

_Note: the style guide will be checked/enforced in GitHub Actions._

### Run your first connector

Connectors can be started using the concept of "launchers", which are essentially compositions of Java modules defined
as gradle build files.

**It is expected that everyone who wants to use the EDC will create their own launcher, customized
to the implemented use cases.**

There is an `ids-connector` launcher, which launches a simple connector that has no cloud-based extensions.
However, it needs an IDS certificate and a running DAPS. So make sure to take a look at
[this guide](./launchers/ids-connector/README.md) first.

Then run

```shell
./gradlew :launchers:ids-connector:shadowJar
java -jar launchers/ids-connector/build/libs/dataspace-connector.jar
```

Once it says `"Dataspace Connector ready"` the connector is up and running.

More information about the extension concept can be found here [TBW].
