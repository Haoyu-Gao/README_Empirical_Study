Add SAML support to your Python software using this library.
Forget those complicated libraries and use the open source library provided
and supported by OneLogin Inc.

This version supports Python3. There is a separate version that only support Python2: [python-saml](https://github.com/onelogin/python-saml)

#### Warning ####

Version 1.8.0 sets strict mode active by default

Update ``python3-saml`` to ``1.5.0``, this version includes security improvements for preventing XEE and Xpath Injections.

Update ``python3-saml`` to ``1.4.0``, this version includes a fix for the [CVE-2017-11427](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-11427/) vulnerability.

This version also changes how the calculate fingerprint method works, and will expect as input a formatted X.509 certificate.

Update ``python3-saml`` to ``1.2.6`` that adds the use defusedxml that will prevent XEE and other attacks based on the abuse of XML. (CVE-2017-9672)

Update ``python3-saml`` to ``>= 1.2.1``, ``1.2.0`` had a bug on signature validation process (when using ``wantAssertionsSigned`` and ``wantMessagesSigned``). [CVE-2016-1000251](https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Database-Artifacts/blob/master/DWF/2016/1000251/CVE-2016-1000251.json)

``1.2.0`` version includes a security patch that contains extra validations that will prevent signature wrapping attacks.

``python3-saml < v1.2.0`` is vulnerable and allows signature wrapping!

#### Security Guidelines ####

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in this toolkit, please report it at https://www.onelogin.com/security with a description. We follow responsible disclosure guidelines, and will work with you to quickly find a resolution.




Installation
------------

### Dependencies ###

 * python 2.7 // python 3.6
 * [xmlsec](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xmlsec) Python bindings for the XML Security Library.
 * [isodate](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isodate) An ISO 8601 date/time/
 duration parser and formatter

Review the ``setup.py`` file to know the version of the library that ``python3-saml`` is using

### Code ###

#### Option 1. Download from GitHub ####

The toolkit is hosted on GitHub. You can download it from:

 * Latest release: https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/releases/latest
 * Master repo: https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master

Copy the core of the library ``(src/onelogin/saml2 folder)`` and merge the ``setup.py`` inside the Python application. (Each application has its structure so take your time to locate the Python SAML toolkit in the best place).

#### Option 2. Download from pypi ####

The toolkit is hosted in pypi, you can find the ``python3-saml`` package at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python3-saml

You can install it executing:
```
$ pip install python3-saml
```

Security Warning
----------------

In production, the **strict** parameter MUST be set as **"true"**. Otherwise
your environment is not secure and will be exposed to attacks.

In production also we highly recommend to register on the settings the IdP certificate instead of using the fingerprint method. The fingerprint, is a hash, so at the end is open to a collision attack that can end on a signature validation bypass. Other SAML toolkits deprecated that mechanism, we maintain it for compatibility and also to be used on test environment.


#### setup.py ####

Setup script is the centre of all activity in building, distributing, and installing modules.
Read more at https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/setuptools.html

#### tests ####

Contains the unit test of the toolkit.

In order to execute the test you only need to load the virtualenv with the toolkit installed on it and execute:
```
python setup.py test
```
The previous line will run the tests for the whole toolkit. You can also run the tests for a specific module. To do so for the auth module you would have to execute this:
```
python setup.py test --test-suite tests.src.OneLogin.saml2_tests.auth_test.OneLogin_Saml2_Auth_Test
```

With the ``--test-suite`` parameter you can specify the module to test. You'll find all the module available and their class names at ``tests/src/OneLogin/saml2_tests/``.
