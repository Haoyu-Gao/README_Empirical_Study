# Editors' Notes

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/editorsnotes/editorsnotes.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/editorsnotes/editorsnotes)

This Django application runs the Editors' Notes API and authentication server.

### Prerequisites
Editors' Notes uses **Python 2.7** and requires [PostgreSQL] (9.4+) and [Elasticsearch].

- [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
- `libxml2`, `libxslt1` (installation details below)

### Installation Steps
#### Option 1: Manual Installation

#### Required services
Consult the documentation of those applications for installation instructions.

#### Dependencies
This project depends on the Python package `lxml`, which has two dependencies:
`libxml2`, and `libxslt1`. They can be installed with your OS's package manager.

- **Ubuntu** (aptitude): `apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev`
- **Fedora** (yum): `yum install libxml2-devel libxslt-devel`
- **OSX** (homebrew): `brew install libxml2 libxslt && brew link libxml2 libxslt`

#### Deployment
See [editorsnotes/editorsnotes.org] for instructions on how to deploy Editors' Notes on a server using nginx and uWSGI.

#### Local development environment
Setting up a local environment requires the Python task runner [Fabric], which can be installed with your package manager. Once it and the dependencies above have been installed, perform the following steps:

1. Run `fab setup` at the project root directory. This will set up a virtual environment for python packages, install all dependencies, make a skeleton configuration file, and collect all necessary static files.

2. Edit the skeleton settings file `editorsnotes/settings_local.py` with information about your system. The only setting you *must* fill out is your database configuration.

3. Run `fab sync_database` to execute all database migrations

4. Start the development server with `fab runserver`

**FIXME: Add section about required editorsnotes-markup-renderer**
