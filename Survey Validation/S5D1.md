## Introduction

This repository contains the command line tools to schedule and run the measurement report as well as a web interface to view the measured metrics in some nice charts.

## Measurement Methodology

The software can orchestrate Docker containers according to a given specification in a usage-flow.json file.

These containers will be set up on the host system and the testing specification in the usage-flow will be run by sending the commands to the containers accordingly.

During this process, the performance metrics of the containers are read through the stream of `docker stats`.

The current limitation of this approach is:
- The resolution of 1s is pretty low
- Docker stats sometimes gives different values than top / /proc/stat depending on your OS configuration
- It does not directly translate into energy without additional measurements

## Usage Scenario

**Step 1:** Make sure you have a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) available with repository access.

**Step 2:** Create a usage scenario JSON file with the commands and required repositories.

**Step 3:** Define the metrics and thresholds for your scenario.

## Server Deployment

Follow the instructions to deploy the server that handles the cron jobs and API calls.

**Step 1:** Clone the repository to your server.

**Step 2:** Install the required packages.

**Step 3:** Set up environment variables and configurations.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:
```
pytest tests/
```

## Example Measurement Data

Refer to the `examples` directory for sample measurement data and configurations.

### Installation Steps

#### Option 1: Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/green-metrics-tool.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd green-metrics-tool
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Option 2: Using Package Manager

## Creating Projects

Refer to the project creation guide available at [Creating Projects Guide](CONFIGURED_URL/request.html). Note: You must enter a GitHub Repo URL with a repository that has the usage_scenario.json in a valid format. Consult [GitHub Repository for the Demo software](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/green-metric-demo-software) for more info.

After creating a project, run:
```
/var/www/cron/runner.sh cron
```

## Implementing a Cronjob (optional)

Run this command as the user for which docker is configured:
```
crontab -e
```

Then install the following cron for `root` to run the job every 15 min:
```
*/15 * * * * rm -Rf /tmp/repo; python3 /var/www/cron/runner.py cron
```

If you have no MTA installed you can also pipe the output to a specific file like so:
```
*/15 * * * * rm -Rf /tmp/repo; python3 /var/www/cron/runner.py cron 2>&1 >> /var/log/cron-green-metric.log
```

If you have docker configured to run in rootless mode be sure to issue the exports for the cron command beforehand. A cronjob in the `crontab -e` of the non-root may look similar to this one:
```
DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1000/docker.sock
*/5 * * * * export PATH=/home/USERNAME/bin:$PATH; rm -Rf /tmp/repo; python3 /var/www/cron/runner.py cron 2>&1 >> /var/log/cron-green-metric.log
```

Also, make sure that `/var/log/cron-green-metric.log` is writable by the user:
```
sudo touch /var/log/cron-green-metric.log && sudo chown MY_USER:MY_USER /var/log/cron-green-metric.log
```

### Locking and Timeout for Cron

Depending on how often you run the cronjob and how long your jobs are, the cronjobs may interleave, which will cause problems.

On a typical Linux system, you can use timeout/flock to prevent this. This example creates an exclusive lock and timeouts to 4 minutes:
```
DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1000/docker.sock
*/5 * * * * export PATH=/home/USERNAME/bin:$PATH; timeout 240s flock -nx /var/lock/greencoding-runner rm -Rf /tmp/repo && python3 /var/www/cron/runner.py cron 2>&1 >> /var/log/cron-green-metric.log
```
