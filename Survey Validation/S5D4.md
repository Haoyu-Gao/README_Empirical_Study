Sulong (Graal LLVM) is an interpreter for LLVM IR written in
Java using the Truffle language implementation framework and Graal as a
just-in-time (JIT) compiler.

With Sulong you can execute C/C++, Fortran, and other programs written
in a LLVM language on the JVM. To execute a program by Sulong, you have
to compile the program to LLVM IR by a LLVM front end such as Clang. By
using Truffle and Java the interpreter implementation is simple and is
thus a great platform for experimentation. On the other hand, dynamic
optimizations and JIT compilation with Graal still provides native
execution speed (improving performance is work in progress). Through
Truffle's language interoperability capabilities, you will soon be able
to call functions from/to other languages on Truffle such as Ruby,
JavaScript, or R.

Build Dependencies
------------------

Sulong is mostly implemented in Java. However, parts of Sulong are
implemented in C/C++ and will be compiled to a shared library or a bitcode
file. For a successful build you need to have LLVM (incl. `CLANG` and `OPT`
tool) v3.2 - v4.0 installed. Sulong also depends on `libc++` and `libc++abi`
(on Ubuntu, install `libc++1`, `libc++abi1`, `libc++-dev`, `libc++abi-dev`).
For a full list of external dependencies on Ubuntu you can look at our
Travis configuration.

MacOS: Apple's default LLVM does not contain the `opt` tool, which a Sulong
build needs. We recommend installing LLVM via `homebrew` and appending the
bin path to the `PATH`.

How to get started?
-------------------

First create a new directory, which will contain the needed GraalVM
projects:

    mkdir sulong-dev && cd sulong-dev

Then, download mx, which is the build tool used by Sulong:

    git clone https://github.com/graalvm/mx
    export PATH=$PWD/mx:$PATH

Next, use git to clone the Sulong project and its dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/graalvm/sulong

Next, you need to download a recent
[labsjdk](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/downloads/index.html).
Extract it inside the `sulong-dev` directory:

    tar -zxf labsjdk-8u111-jvmci-0.23-linux-amd64.tar.gz

Set `JAVA_HOME` to point to the extracted labsjdk from above:

    echo JAVA_HOME=`pwd`/labsjdk1.8.0_111-jvmci-0.23 > sulong/mx.sulong/env

Finally, build the project:

    cd sulong && mx build

The mx tool will ask you to choose between its server and jvmci
configuration. For now, just select server. You can read the differences
between the configurations on
[the Graal wiki](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Graal/Instructions). The first
build will take some time because mx has not only to build Sulong,
but also its dependencies and the Graal VM.

Now, Sulong is ready to start. You can for example compile a C file named
`test.c` (see further below) with mx and then use Sulong to execute it:

    mx su-clang -c -emit-llvm -o test.bc test.c
    mx su-run test.bc

For best experience we suggest to use clang 3.8, though versions 3.2, 3.3 and
3.8 to 4.0 should also work. Additionally, if you compile with the `-g` option
Sulong can provide source-file information in stacktraces.

Libraries to load can be specified using the `-l` flag, as in a compiler:

    mx su-run -lz test.bc

If you want to use the project from within Eclipse, use the following
command to generate the Eclipse project files (there is also mx ideinit
for other IDEs):

    mx eclipseinit

If you want to use the project from within Intellij Idea, use the following
command instead:

    mx intellijinit

If you also want to edit the mx configuration files from within Idea, you can
append the `--mx-python-modules` argument to this. Since the configuration files
consist of Python code, you will probably want to install the
[Python Language Support Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/631-python).

If you want to inspect the command line that mx generates for a mx
command you can use the -v flag.

Sulong Library Files
--------------------

You can package LLVM bitcode and a list of library dependencies using the
`su-link` linker command to create a `.su` file which is easy to manage and
distribute. You can also specify other libraries to load when this library
is loaded using the `-l` flag:

    mx su-link -o test.su -lz test.bc

You can run this `.su` file directly and it will know to load dependencies that
you specified at link-time:

    mx su-run test.su
