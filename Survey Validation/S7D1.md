Hylaa (**HY**brid **L**inear **A**utomata **A**nalyzer) is a verification tool for system models with linear ODEs, time-varying inputs, and possibly hybrid dynamics. 

This is the continuous branch of Hylaa, where we focus on safety verification of strictly linear models. The goal is to scale to very large systems with dynamics given by sparse matrices A.

The latest version of Hylaa is always available on our GitHub repository at [Hylaa GitHub](https://github.com/stanleybak/hylaa). A website for Hylaa is maintained at [Stanley Bak's Website](http://stanleybak.com/hylaa).

The code was mostly written by Stanley Bak ([Stanley Bak's Website](http://stanleybak.com)) with input from Parasara Sridhar Duggirala ([Parasara Sridhar Duggirala's Website](http://engr.uconn.edu/~psd)). Work on this branch was also done by Dung Hoang Tran.

Hylaa is released under the GPL v3 license (see the LICENSE file). It has been approved for public release (DISTRIBUTION A: Approved for public release; distribution unlimited #88ABW-2016-5976, 22 NOV 2016).

### Prerequisites

Hylaa is mostly written in Python, with a few C++ parts (linear programming solving, GPU interface). You'll need to get a few required libraries, compile the C++ portions as shared libraries, and then set up the environment variables. Even if you’re not planning on using a GPU, you still need to install CUDA to use their compiler.

These instructions are made for an Ubuntu system, such as the Amazon EC2 GPU instance (p2.xlarge) using the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Server image.

- Python
- C++ Compiler
- CUDA Toolkit

### Installation Steps:

#### Option 1: Manual Installation

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib make nvidia-cuda-toolkit
```

##### Compile GLPK Interface as Shared Library

This is a custom C++ interface to GLPK for use in Hylaa that you need to compile. See hylaa/glpk-interface/README for details on how to do this. Essentially, you need to get glpk-4.60 and build it.

```sh
# Navigate to the GLPK directory and follow the compilation instructions.
```

##### Setup Environment Variables

```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/compiled/libs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

#### Option 2: Using Package Manager

*To be added if available*

#### Verification

To verify the successful installation, run the following command:

```sh
python modelname.py
```

#### Advanced Option

*To be added if available*

### Basic Usage Example

The easiest way to use Hylaa on your example is to copy an example from the examples folder and edit that. Notice that it’s python code that creates the sparse A matrix. This means you can create the model programmatically using loops (as we do in the heat system) or by loading the dynamics from a .mat file (as we do for MNA5).
