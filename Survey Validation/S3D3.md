The Python auto-instrumentation libraries for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (per [OTEP 0001](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/master/text/0001-telemetry-without-manual-instrumentation.md))

## Prerequisites

This project is built based on `Python`. Make sure to use `Python 3.x` before getting started. Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Installation Steps:

Choose one of the following options to install the project:

#### Option 1: Manual Installation

This repository includes installable packages for each instrumented library. Libraries that produce telemetry data should only depend on `opentelemetry-api`, and defer the choice of the SDK to the application developer. Applications may depend on `opentelemetry-sdk` or another package that implements the API.

**Please note** that these libraries are currently in _beta_, and shouldn't generally be used in production environments.

The [`instrumentation/`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/master/instrumentation) directory includes OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages, which can be installed separately as:

```sh
pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-{integration}
```

To install the development versions of these packages instead, clone or fork this repo and do an [editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs):

```sh
pip install -e ./ext/opentelemetry-ext-{integration}
```

#### Option 2: Using Package Manager

TODO

#### Verification

To verify the successful installation, run the following command:

```
python -m pip show opentelemetry-instrumentation-{integration}
```

#### Advanced Option

## Running Tests Locally

1. Go to your Contrib repo directory. `cd ~/git/opentelemetry-python-contrib`.
2. Create a virtual env in your Contrib repo directory. `python3 -m venv my_test_venv`.
3. Activate your virtual env. `source my_test_venv/bin/activate`.
4. Clone the [OpenTelemetry Python](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python) Python Core repo to a folder named `opentelemetry-python-core`. `git clone git@github.com:open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python.git opentelemetry-python-core`.
5. Change directory to the repo that was just cloned. `cd opentelemetry-python-core`.
6. Move the head of this repo to the hash you want your tests to use. This is currently the tag `v0.15b0` as seen in `.github/workflows/test.yml`. Use `git fetch --tags && git checkout v0.15b0`.
7. Go back to the root directory. `cd ../`.
8. Make sure you have `tox` installed. `pip install tox`.
9. Run tests for a package. (e.g. `tox -e test-instrumentation-flask`.)
