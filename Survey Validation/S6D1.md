The Eclipse Dataspace Connector provides a framework for sovereign, inter-organizational data exchange. It will
implement the International Data Spaces standard (IDS) as well as relevant protocols associated with GAIA-X. The
connector is designed to be highly modular and extensible, allowing easy integration of custom data processing pipelines and protocols.

## Prerequisites

The project requires JDK 11+. Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- [JDK 11+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

## Installation Steps:

### Option 1: Manual Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector.git

cd DataSpaceConnector

./gradlew clean build
```

This will build the connector and run unit tests.

### [Optional] Setup your IDE

If you wish to configure your IDE/editor to automatically apply the EDC code style, please
follow [this guide](styleguide.md).

_Note: the style guide will be checked/enforced in GitHub Actions._

### Run your first connector

Connectors can be started using the concept of "launchers", which are essentially compositions of Java modules defined
as gradle build files.

**It is expected that everyone who wants to use the EDC will create their own launcher, customized
to the implemented use cases.**

There is an `ids-connector` launcher, which launches a simple connector that has no cloud-based extensions.
However, it needs an IDS certificate and a running DAPS. So make sure to take a look at
[this guide](./launchers/ids-connector/README.md) first.

Then run

```shell
./gradlew :launchers:ids-connector:shadowJar
java -jar launchers/ids-connector/build/libs/dataspace-connector.jar
```

Once it says `"Dataspace Connector ready"` the connector is up and running.

More information about the extension concept can be found here [TBW].
