# Puzzle [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Test Coverage][coveralls-img]][coveralls-url]

Variant Caller GUI and genetic disease analysis tool.

Try the online [demo](https://puzzle-demo-robinandeer.c9.io) or install and run locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/robinandeer/puzzle.git
$ cd puzzle
$ pip install --editable .
$ puzzle view -i tests/fixtures/
# open webbrowser on port 5000
$ open http://localhost:5000
```

## Using Puzzle
Puzzle will look for variant calling resources such as VCF files and [GEMINI][gemini] databases and visualize their content. It lets you inspect, annotate, and analyze variant calls.

Puzzle is not primarily meant to be run as a persistant server but think of it more as an webinterface to quickly spin to visualize your variant calls.

We set out to make `Puzzle` both very simple to install as well as intuitive to use. You can be up and running in minutes with minimal prerequisites.

### Prerequisites
This project is built based on Python. Make sure to use Python 3.x before getting started. Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation Steps:
Choose one of the following options to install the project:

#### Option 1: Manual Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/robinandeer/puzzle.git
$ cd puzzle
$ pip install --editable .
$ puzzle view -i tests/fixtures/
# open webbrowser on port 5000
$ open http://localhost:5000
```

#### Verification
To verify the successful installation, run the following command:
```bash
$ puzzle view -i tests/fixtures/
```

## Developing Puzzle
Puzzle is a Python Flask app with a command line interface. It can work with multiple backends using plugins; raw VCFs, GEMINI, MongoDB.

Anyone can help make this project better - read [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started!

### Install for development
I decided to try out [Otto][otto] for this project so make sure you have it installed :smile:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/robinandeer/puzzle.git
$ cd puzzle
$ otto dev
$ otto dev ssh
> npm install
> sudo apt-get install vim python-pip git
> pip install --user --editable .
> puzzle /vagrant/tests/
# open webbrowser on port 5000
```

## Use a gemini database
Make sure you have gemini installed in your local environment

```bash
puzzle --mode gemini view -i path/to/gemini_database.db
```

## Use ped info
Puzzle uses the ped file to show more information in family view and in variant calls:

```bash
puzzle view -i tests/fixtures/hapmap.vcf --family_file/-f tests/fixtures/hapmap.vcf
```
