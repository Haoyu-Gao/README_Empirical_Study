Adds README.md file based on the Redo Backup and Recovery Sourceforge project's
summary page [1].

The screenshots under the 'Project Samples' have also been included in the
README.md file.  Given these screenshots are JPEG files, git LFS is used to
track these files.

762da501efed74cb13788abbb1589482e9da40bb,"Adds build scripts based on old Redo Backup and Recovery v1.0.3 instructions

Adapts the Sourceforge Wiki instructions [1] for building the Redo Backup and
Recovery v1.0.3 source code release, into an initial series of shell scripts.
Concise documentation as well as a Dockerfile and Makefile have also been
added.

Background: The most recent Redo Backup and Recovery source code release
tarball is v1.0.4, which builds an Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) ISO image.
The earlier releases, v0.9.8 through to v1.0.3, build an Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick
Meerkat) ISO images. The Sourceforge Wiki currently has two sets of
instructions: v1.0.4 published on Nov 21 2012, and the v1.0.3 published on Sep
9 2012 [2].

To provide the ability to build the v0.9.8-v1.0.3 releases historically
accurately, this commit adapts the v1.0.3 instructions. For maximum
auditability, described below is the full list of adaptations between the build
scripts in this commit and the v1.0.3 instructions. The v1.0.4 instructions are
adapted in a subsequent commit.

* Replaced semicolon-delimited ""one-liners"" with newlines, for readability
* Use variables instead of hardcoding APT mirror, Ubuntu codename, CPU architecture
* Restructure expected paths to support cleaning up builds and version-controlling
  source code:
  * Use directory named ""src/"" (for version-controlled source code), instead of
    extracting a snapshot tarball every build
  * Use directory named ""build/"", for build working dir, instead of the ambiguously
    named ""livecd/"" directory
* Ensure no user-interactivity required once build launched:
  * Package installation configured to be non-interactive/unattended via
    debconf/frontend ""Noninteractive"" setting.
  * Customizes plymouth boot splash screen image using `update-alternatives
     --set` instead of the interactive `update-alternatives --config`
  * locale.nopurge config file provided (via a heredoc) based on the
    auto-generated file in the official v0.9.8-v1.0.4 ISO images
* Copy isolinux.bin from host, not the chroot, as the Wiki page [1] documents
  running `apt-get install syslinux` on the host, not from within the chroot.
* Install memtest86+ package on the host system, rather than assume presence.
* Adapt the ""correct the MD5 checksums"" instructions into a scripted
  workaround, and document the root cause: mkisofs's ""-boot-info-table""
  argument modifying isolinux.bin
* Based on the CHANGELOG and analysis of the official ISO images, for
  historical accuracy of v0.9.8-v1.0.3 builds, the following packages listed in
  the v1.0.3 instructions have been removed:
  * ntfs-3g           (added in v0.9.9)
  * wodim             (added in v1.0.0)
  * system-config-lvm (added in v1.0.1)
  * wget              (added in v1.0.2)

Additionally, added supporting files:

* Adds a simple Makefile to launch the build script.
* Adds a Dockerfile to construct a simple ""host system"" environment
* Adds documentation describing how to launch build

Renames project Rescuezilla instead of ""Redo Backup and Recovery"" in the files
not directly associated with application functionality, such as the README
file, the ISOLINUX boot menu, the desktop entry files etc.

French and German translations have also been modified in a few places,
something which has been avoided in prior commits as much as possible to
prevent mistranslation. Given string literal 'Redo Backup' appears in the
French and German translations as an unmodified proper noun that doesn't appear
to have any kind of language-specific acronym or gendered suffixes,
substitution is unlikely to cause unintelligible text (but should certainly
help reduce confusion with the abandoned 'Redo Backup and Recovery'
application).

2fd14b57151bb0ed582288ea2ea0602c7991e540,"Clarifies that Rescuezilla is not a *trivial* fork

Clarifies that while Rescuezilla is indeed a fork, it's actually been rebuilt
from the ground up to support Clonezilla, and has features *beyond* Clonezilla.

This is to address misconceptions in earlier drafts of this blog post [1], as
well as in-person chats with people about Rescuezilla who understandably may
initially think it's a trivial fork of Redo Backup and Recovery without the
significant additional features and development of its complete rebuild from
the ground up.
