* Item table fixes

* Fixed fullcalendar print css not included

* Asset list table improvements

* Tweak asset list to be more in line with other lists

* Versioning template improvements

//TODO Rather than have seperate asset templates, convert 'id' into a template variable

Asset specific templates begone. Still need to bring back the ID formatting for the Rigboard.

* Asset form fixes

* Use the right autocompleter.js...

The model remains in RIGS for now, as it's pretty painful to move...

TODO - need to ensure moved models are *moved* rather than deleted and recreated!

* Init other tests, more rigs test faffery

* Fix the remaining tests

* Ensure submit button is scrolled to in tests

* Make CI use latest (stable) chromedriver rather than some ancient one

Since Travis uses the latest stable chrome, should always match. Bash oneliner \o/

* Of course | is part of YAML syntax, of course...

Maybe this works.

* Update python version

Trying to get CI to match my local environment as much as possible...

* Start RA 'mark review' feature

* Insert a divider between still-out dry hires and actually upcoming events on rigboard

* Initial work on new checklist handling. No more JSON!

* Versioning module now does magic

Automatic creation of views/urls for anything registered with reversion, with a small amount of hackage to preserve legacy stuff. (and the DAMNED asset IDs!) I would never get distracted...

* Cleanup

* Invoice template improvements

* Minor fixes

* More tweaks

* More fixes

* Major improvements/fixes to authorisation templates

* Remove database ID from generic list

* Put power threshold values in a collapse
