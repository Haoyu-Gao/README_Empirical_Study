417f649c12505eeb6569965d03a6850e6a7b62b0,"Release v3.1.0 (#419)

* first package draft

- removed statics
- add inline style to error.html
- allow sha256 to deliver the error.html
- added utils.coreBasePath to reference the package path

* Replaced db.py with a empty proxy to viur.datastore, removed depenencies for viur.core.db

* chore: update dependencies

* added github actions

* Added viur-datastore to requirements.txt

* Replaced calls to KeyClass with Key in tasks.py

* fix: update

* Re-Added translation() jinja2 function

* Fixed allocateIDs, updated viur.datastore to 0.3

* chore: disabled changelog check

* fix: update requirements and  version

* fix: added missing pytz

* Updated viur-datastore to 0.5

* Fixed deleteRecursive function in files

* Fixed ratelimit module

* Fixed running on Python 3.10

* Pass bone.getEmptyValue() in json render structure, handle custom types in CustomJsonEncoder

* Allow setBoneValue setting values to Empty again

* feat: added configureable db engine

- reuse db.py
- added viur.db.engine in conf

* Fixed serializing randomSliceBone

* Updated viur-datastore to 0.6

* Updated changelog

* deleteRecursive function in tree-prototype

* Fixed the new import system, updated viur-datastore to 0.7

* Fixed querying randomSliceBone with new datastore adapter

* Allow configuring the expiration of downloadURLs generated by JSON render

* Correct the response status code

Use the shorter `name` variable of the `HTTPException` instead of the verbose `descr`.
Then we also use the Reason-Phrases suggested in the RFC 7231 Sec. 6.1 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6.1).

Test with:
```py
class Index(BasicApplication):
	@exposed
	def testEx(self):
		raise errors.NotFound()
```
and
```sh
curl -I http://localhost:8080/testEx
```

Old result:
```plain
HTTP/1.1 404 The requested resource could not be found.
...
```

New result:
```plain
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

* Disolved the redirect method in request.py

Fixes #367

* Updated viur-datastore to 0.8

* Fixed killSessionByUser function

* Fixed files embedded in textbones expiring

* Added support for src-sets in textBones

* Updated requirements, fixed logging

* revert old csp work around and added new extendCsp rules for error pages and google login

* cleaning unnecessary paths

* update requirements

* removed old datastore import

* updated gitignore

* readded path updates

* updated version

* removed github action for auto PyPI automatic release

* added pipenv script shortcuts to build and release on PyPI

* added requirements.txt to package_data

* Provide a get() function for skel.get() as well

* Don't use repr() as fallback for string

This breaks output of skeletons in HTML

* Log higher severity errors raises from bones

Provide a viur.debug.skeleton.fromClient config flag to log debug, which is easier for development.

* Fix: Don't fail when bone_unqiueIndexValue is None

This bug raises when a skeleton was configured to use unique bones while data has previously been written.

* RelSkel.unserialize() should accept dict

This is also stated in the docstring before, but didn't work as subsequent calls access properties not implemented in dict.

* Set x-viur-error in header with exception description

This enables Ajax-requests to access detailed information when something went wrong. This is already implemented in flare, for example.

* Fixes for second factor login in relation to ViUR3

* Fixes and improvements for the tree prototype

* Set content-type to application/json in dumpConfig

* Remove unused parameters from singleValueUnserialize

* Accept single values for multiple=True bones

This...
```python
b = stringBone(multiple=True)

skel[""b""] = ""test""
```
...will write `['t', 'e', 's', 't']` into the bone in the datastore.

This fix will write `[""test""]`, as wanted.

* Allow overriding the fileName under wich a blob will be downloaded

* Update package requirements

* Update package requirements

* fix: removed forgotten resources js, code was embedded with sha to respect CSP

* Revert ""Update package requirements""

This reverts commit bb5addd62e2fada49fabac5d55d29d39b3795a24.

* Added support for new downloadUrl format in textBone

* Replaced original PR by assertion

* Simplified rootNode check condition as discussed

* fixed singleValueUnserialize in selectCountryBone.py

* Set parentnode and parentrepo before fromClient() (#402)

This change sets the readOnly-bones parentnode and parentrepo of a TreeSkel before the fromClient call. The reason for this is, that in a specific use-case, a unique value is build, which may only be unique per repository. This construction was made in a custom fromClient function implemented on the Skeleton, which requires the parentrepo to be known.

* Implement baseSkel for all module prototypes (#378)

* Provide a baseSkel for all prototypes

* Fixing some docstrings and function order.

* Update tree.py

* Update tree.py

* Fixed unique=True on multiple=True relationalBones (#401)

* Fixed deferred calls with _countdown set failing when called from a cronjob (#403)

* selectBone() values accept for list, tuple or callable (#390)

* selectBone() values accept for list, tuple or callable

- list and tuple are converted to dict
- callable allows to obtain values on demand by a callback

* Also recognize ISO3 codes

* Translate list/tuple-based values

* Fixed bug with userSkel.access-bone

This came in with the new selectBone implementation.

* Updated CHANGELOG.md

* Updated requirements.txt (#408)

* Fixed caching module, updated viur-datastore to 1.1 (#407)

* Fixed caching module, updated viur-datastore to 1.1

Replaces #406

* Fix `setBoneValue` to work with multiple and language bones (#410)

A value via `BaseSkeleton.setBoneValue()` was not setable to
a multiple or language `selectBone` and `stringBone`.
* Extend `baseBone.setBoneValue()` to fix this
* Add `language` parameter in `BaseSkeleton.setBoneValue()`
* Correct default `defaultValue` for multiple and language `selectBone`
* Fix and add several relatet docstrings and type annotations
