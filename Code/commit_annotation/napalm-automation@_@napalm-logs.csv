Previously we were loading the default OC object each time, however
as we do not use any of the defaults there isn't much point as it
drastically slows things down.

Another benefit of loading it each time is to make sure the OC object is
correctly defined, however this does not need to be done every time.
Therefore in future it should be checked manually before submitting /
accepting new message config.

The priority is made up of facility * 8 + severity

So to get the severity and facility from to priority you need to do:

facility = floor(priority / 8)
severity = priority - (facility * 8)
