* Add support for inputs without bounding box labels to PointPillars by returning zero size dimension arrays where needed. (#361)

* Update `collect_bboxes.py` to support datasets beyond KITTI (#358)

Modified `collect_bboxes.py` to take an optional argument `--dataset_type` which allows for an arbitrary dataset name. I have a custom dataset that is KITTI-like but expects a different input file format, and this change allows me to run the `collect_bboxes.py` script on my dataset.

* PyTorch PointPillars - Fix out of bounds pillar coordinates (#349) (#350)

Fixed #349 by doing pseudo image bounds check and removing out of bounds pillars.

* Move zero sized elements to device to prevent concatenation of mixed device tensors (#377)

Without this change, the NuScenes dataset crashes 20% of the way through the first epoch due to mixed elements being concatenated together.

* Parallelize collect_bboxes (#387)

The bbox data augmentation table generation is embarrasingly parallel. This commit rewrites collect_bboxes to use Python's multiprocessing API to parallelize the processing across a configurable number of CPUs in order to significantly speed up generation.

On KITTI, the single threaded collect_bboxes took several minutes; with 16 cores, it takes only a few seconds. This scalability is particularly important for larger datasets (either with more datapoints or larger point clouds) which can take hours to process without parallelization.

* Avoid mAP NaNs when zero ground truth or predicted boxes exist (#382)

Without these changes, the mAP computation will produce NaNs for scenes where it predicts no bounding boxes or there are no ground truth bounding boxes, which occurs in practice in several datasets or with poorly trained networks.

* Added support for optional use of `validation_freq` to set how often validation runs during training (#385)

Without this change, the validation step runs after every epoch which can significantly slow down training. This change allows the number of epochs between validation steps to be configurable, while maintaining the default behavior of validating after every epoch if unconfigured.
