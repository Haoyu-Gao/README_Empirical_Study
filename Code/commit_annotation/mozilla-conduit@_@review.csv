Summary:

`moz-phab` is rebasing only the commits within the commit stack. If any
of the commit is a DAG branch point and is amended during the submit
process, the feature branch will not be rebased and will be left
attached to the obsolete commit.

With this patch `moz-phab` is storing the commits children when
building the commit stack and is using this info to rebase feature
branches in the `finalize` stage.

DAG branch points ca't be in stack if no evolve extension is installed.

0eaeeb9fe609eacf432f9aa8bc29de4b94af327c,"uplifts: add a `moz-phab` uplift command (Bug 1737838) r?zeid

Add a `moz-phab uplift` command to send commits to Phabricator
to be reviewed as uplift requests. The interface is similar to
`moz-phab submit`, in that a revset/commit range is specified
for submission, but the user must also pass a `--train` argument
with a Phabricator callsign indicating the target uplift train
to submit to. The target repos are any repository on Phabricator
with an `uplift` project tag associated with the repository. If the
repository has an appropriate named tag/bookmark/branch associated
with the passed train, a new set of revisions will be created via
rebase and the new commits will be submitted for uplift. When amending
the commits, the `Differential Revision` of the original revision
is moved to `Original Revision` and the uplift revision is set as
the `Differential Revision`.

To keep uplifting behaviour consistent with regular submissions the
`uplift` command re-uses almost all of the logic of `submit`, with
a few amendments that check the value of `args.command` to determine
if the uplift specific code paths should be taken. The `submit`
CLI argument parser is turned into a function so it can be re-used
by the `submit` parser.

A conduit function call is added to return repositories with an
associated tag, in our case the `uplift` tag. We add a few VCS specific
functions to associate a callsign with a named branch/symbol and to
perform the automatic uplifting functionality.

d629bd368de5ddc487911e71a8fe6ec2830162d4,"args: add diff ID flag to patch command (Bug 1534707) r=sheehan

Right now users cannot specify a diff ID within a revision's history
when patching. Being able to specify a diff allows for investigating
older diffs and provides and easy way to rollback.

This change lets users use `--diff-id` to supply a number as long as
it is a Diff ID that belongs to a revision in the stack, it will
apply changes from the diff to the local repo being patched.

This will retrieve the diff via ID and replace the existing diff info
for that revision with the requested diff's info.

bebb8fac789dcea75f35e4a88f57ae2d296b1911,"reorg: add a `--no-abandon` flag (Bug 1654837) r=grammar

Adds a `--no-abandon` flag to avoid abandoning revisions during
`moz-phab reorg`. Revisions are abandoned when they are present
in the remote Phabricator stack but dropped from the local VCS
stack. This flag avoids adding the `abandon` transaction when
the flag is passed on the command line.

4f2fcbfc5a988384f721cefe8b5b998d2652edf1,"patch: make branch name configurable (Bug 1826125) r=zeid

Adds a `patch.branch_name_template` config knob to control
the name used as the branch name for a new bookmark/branch.
This knob takes a single format template, `rev_id`, which
is the rev id of the revision being patched. The current
default value is `phab-D{rev_id}` and that is set as the
default value in the config. Move branch name resolution
into a separate `resolve_branch_name` function and add a
test for it.
