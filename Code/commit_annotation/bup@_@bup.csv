bab7b16b760ba1fd686f6f5b274fc8ba2ad360e2,"cmd/restore: embarrassingly slow implementation of 'bup restore'

Well, that was easy, since vfs.py already existed and is doing most of the
hard work.  Only 103 lines including all the log message handling and
whatnot.

Only one catch: the restoring code is definitely not optimized.  Among other
things (like the probably-excessive-for-our-restoring-needs layering in
vfs.py), we're still calling into 'git cat-file --stdin' to retrieve our
objects.  This involves lots and lots of context switches, plus it can't use
midx files for its lookups.  The result is that restoring takes much more
CPU time and memory than it really should.  But oh well, we have to start
somewhere.

9277b335d0be832b19f95f5f77f0c3bd29362a5b,"Wrap readline oursleves to avoid py3's interference

We don't want Python to ""help"" us by guessing and insisting on the
encoding before we can even look at the incoming data, so wrap
readline ourselves, with a bytes-oriented (and more direct) API.  This
will allows us to preserve the status quo for now (and maintain parity
between Python 2 and 3) when using Python 3 as we remove our LC_CTYPE
override.

At least on Linux, readline --cflags currently defines _DEFAULT_SOURCE
and defines _XOPEN_SOURCE to 600, and the latter conflicts with a
setting of 700 via Python.h in some installations, so for now, just
defer to Python as long as it doesn't choose an older version.

earler version, and help figuring out the #define arrangement.

Now that we've made adjustments to work around all the Python 3
problems with non-Unicode data (argv, env vars, readline, acls, users,
groups, hostname, etc.), and added randomized binary path and argv
testing, stop overriding the LC_CTYPE since that should no longer be
necessary.

Thanks to Johannes Berg for nudging me to consider whether we might
now be in a position to do this (with a bit more work), and for quite
a bit of help getting all the precursors in place once we thought it
was feasible.

Use some own C code instead of the posix1e python bindings, as those
don't have correct 'bytes' support (at least right now), which means
that we cannot use them with arbitrary file, user and group names.

Instead of having some testing code interleaved with bup's
real code in lib/bup/test/ and lib/bup/t/ move everything
related to testing into test/, which is also renamed from
just t/.

This aligns with pytest for future changes, and, almost more
importantly, cleans up the lib/ directory to only have the
operational code.

The latter is necessary to properly 'libify' bup in order to
be able to use tox properly to test with different versions
of python in venv later.
