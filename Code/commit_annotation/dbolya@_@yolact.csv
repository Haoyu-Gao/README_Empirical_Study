Instead of keeping the data in two separate folders (train2014 and val2014), we keep them all in the images folder together. Also images are now stored with 2017 filenames instead of 2014 (so %012d.jpg instead of COCO_train2014_%012d.jpg, etc. To account for this, I redid the COCO data downloading script, and we now treat the 2017 annotations as trainval35k and minival5k.",2018-09-14 21:23:29-07:00,True

* allow Anaconda to manage all dependencies

for easy setup.

allows to run
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
and have working all dependencies for the project

* temp fix for torchvision bug

needs Pillow < 7.0

* document additional requirement: nvidia-drivers

* add dependency for KDE - PyQt5

* Readme: mention conda env method for installing dependencies

* fix cuda GPU versions

add note on matching CUDA package install

* Rewrote the README changes to flow better.

* conda: review feedback: torch-gpu>=1.0.1

as 1.0 is not enough, some needed feature in 1.0.1,
conda has 1.2, 1.3.1 versions anyway.

* conda: add cuDNN, use pytorch channel

all versions of CUDA+cuDNN+cudatoolkit+pytorch now match and work
(are compiled) together, on host only needed to have/install
nvidia-driver
