b0b38eeb5397cfea82c1960456b89add5b9d7693,"Move runtime resources (translations and icons) to the package directory

There are several reasons for it:

- It is difficult to determine where setuptools did install the data files.
  We are using directories from QStandardPaths, but they are not necessarily
  the same location. There were hacks for Windows and for virtualenvs, but
  some cases were still not covered, such as Homebrew. Moreover, it is
  possible to pass arbitrary --install-data to setup.py.

- data_files is deprecated because it does not work with wheels. Setuptools
  documentation recommends installing resources into the package directory:
  https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html.

- Using the package directory makes the code simpler and faster.

The application icon, desktop and appdata files remain in data_files because
they are not runtime resources, but are needed for packaging in Linux distros.",2021-07-22 16:23:04+03:00,False
