CLOUDBLD-8090

The reason for adding this flag is because of a dependency pruning feature
added to Go 1.17. For compatibility reasons, the ""go mod tidy"" command
always runs the algorithm of the previous Go version. As a result, the
dependencies fetched with ""go mod download"" differ from the ones traversed
by ""go mod tidy"". This makes it impossible to run ""go mod tidy"" pointing the
GOCACHE to the tarball generated by Cachito on Go 1.17.
