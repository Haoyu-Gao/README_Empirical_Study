4585f7a432fcab46d8ea0856025bf0e7e7add20b,"package,readme: support dependency verification though gradle nightlies

The only other options I could find to do this don't work on gradle 5+,
which is what travis ships with. It also has some open bugs about not
actually verifying transitive dependencies, so I would rather use a
nightly gradle than that.",2020-01-20 06:12:05-07:00,True

531a9a8554fb5bba2103b12b0cf67b35450ced32,"package: use a central verification-metadata file

This lets us have better control over which dependencies are verified,
as changes to runelite-client's dependencies cause all Hub plugins with
pinned deps to fail, as the new transitive deps aren't pinned. Moving
this file into this repo not only lets us update it in these situations,
but also means individual plugin authors don't need to touch Gradle's
verification and all of it's associated pains. This also allows plugins
to pull a dependency that another plugin pulls already with no extra
work.",2021-02-26 10:23:08-07:00,True
