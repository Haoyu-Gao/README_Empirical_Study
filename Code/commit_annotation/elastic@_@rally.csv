is preserved however (i.e. on first invocation, Rally will write
the configuration, afterwards it will run the 'all' stage by
default).

This is intended for end users which are more likely to be
interested in performance characteristics of releases in
contrast to core developers which also want to know performance
characteristics of development versions.
