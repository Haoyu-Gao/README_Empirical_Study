Implements JWT signing and encryption for the Eligibility Verification API requests and responses. 

* JWK, JWE, JWS functionality provided via [jwcrypto](https://github.com/latchset/jwcrypto)
* Cryptographic primitives provided by [cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography)
* Signing and encryption parameters and keys stored with Django models
* Sample keys for local testing

# High-level algorithm

1. Create JWT with claims from user form submission
2. Sign JWT with agency's private key to create JWS
3. Create JWE using JWS as plaintext input
4. Encrypt JWE with Eligibility Verification server's public key

The reverse steps are applied to decrypt response tokens with the agency's private key, and then verify the server's signature.",2020-12-03 20:57:56-08:00,FALSE
